My First observation is that the drugs that were used to fight the tumor volume did decrease the volume. In the line graph the drug Calomylin shows that there is a decrease in the tumor volume for a time. However, it is also worth noting that as the time point ended in that graph, the tumor volume did increase. This is probably due to the cancer cells continuing to adapt the drug.

My second obserations is that there is a correlation in tumor volume and the weight of the mouse. This could be due to the fact that the tumor is actually adding weight to the mouse or that the larger the mouse is the harder it is for them to fight off the tumor.

My third observation is that is that the some drugs were tried more than others. This could obviously be due to their percieved sccess in the mice or perhaps it is due to the wanting to know more about the drugs.
